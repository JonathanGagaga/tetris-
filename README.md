This game has started since May 2019 and I am still trying to make it bring more fun for players.
It was difficult for me to figure out how to re-assign unit shapes' positions after rotations and dropping down with JavaScript.
The game was developed without angularjs framework, and I am trying to migrate it to angularjs.
